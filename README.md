# wsj-remove-banner

Firefox extension to cleanse wsj.com of a huge advertisement at the top of the page.

I'm not against advertisements, but when you're a paying customer you shouldn't have to get the top 25% of the page taken up by obnoxious ads.

# Install

Download `wsj_remove_banner-1.0-an+fx.xpi`.

Open firefox (82) -> Settings -> Addons -> Extensions -> Gear icon -> Install Add-on From File.

Select the .xpi file from above.
